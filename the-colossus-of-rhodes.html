                    <h1>The Colossus Of Rhodes</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Colossus of Rhodes was a gigantic 33-metre-high statue of the sun god Helios.
                            In 280 BCE, it was one of the most important trading ports in the ancient 
                            Mediterranean. Made by the local sculptor 'Chares' using bronze, the 
                            statue soon appeared on contemporary travel writer’s lists of must-see 
                            sights and was thus known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 
                            Sadly, the giant Helios did not last long. Toppled by an earthquake in 228 
                            or 226 BCE, its massive broken pieces cluttered the docks of Rhodes for a 
                            millennium before being melted down as scrap in the mid-7th century CE.
                        </p>
                         
                         <h2>Helios and Rhodes</h2> 
                         
                         <p> 
                            Helios was the god of the Sun, offspring of the Titans Hyperion and Theia. 
                            One place Helios was particularly worshipped was at Rhodes, the largest of 
                            the Dodecanese islands of Greece in the eastern Mediterranean. There he was 
                            the most important deity, their patron god, and honoured by the Halieia 
                            festival, the highlight of the island’s religious calendar and a Pan-Hellenic 
                            games much like the ancient Olympic Games.
                        </p>
                            
                         <p>
                            The city of Rhodes, with its five harbours, was ideally placed on the island 
                            of the same name to prosper from trade during the Hellenistic domination of 
                            the Mediterranean under Alexander the Great’s successors, especially when
                            more and more cities were established in the East. The island’s wealth and 
                            strategic position on trade routes did not go unnoticed by ambitious foreign 
                            rulers. Antigonus I (382 - 301 BCE), one of Alexander’s successors who 
                            controlled Macedon and northern Greece, was one such ruler, and he sent his 
                            son Demetrius I of Macedon (336 - 282 BCE) to attack Rhodes in 305-4 BCE. 
                            The island’s recent alliance with Antigonus’ rival Ptolemy I (366 - 282 
                            BCE) in Egypt was another reason to attack Rhodes and neutralise its powerful
                            naval fleet.

                            After a 12-month siege, the Rhodians and their formidable fortifications 
                            stood firm, and Demetrius negotiated a truce and abandoned the blockade. 
                            The Macedonian prince gained his nickname “the Besieger of Cities” but not 
                            much else. Demetrius left behind so much siege engine material, including 
                            one 36.5 metres (120 ft) high tower, that the Rhodians were able to sell 
                            it off for a handsome profit. The polis or city-state already had plenty 
                            of money from its lucrative control of trade and there seemed no better 
                            way to spend this new windfall than on a massive statue in honour of their 
                            patron god, a move which celebrated the island’s hard-won freedom and which
                            might perhaps perpetuate the good times the island was enjoying in the 
                            4th century BCE.

                        <h2>The Colossus</h2>

                        <p>
                            The man commissioned with the Herculean task of sculpting the giant Helios
                            was Chares of Lindus (a city on Rhodes). The project would not be finished 
                            until c. 280 BCE, and as the 1st-century CE Roman writer Pliny the Elder 
                            noted, it cost 300 talents and took at least 12 years to complete the bronze 
                            figure which stood some 70 cubits or 33 metres (108 ft) high. It is likely 
                            that the bronze outer shell, presumably applied in sheets and assembled on 
                            site, was supported by internal struts made of iron and certain pieces were 
                            weighted with stones to increase the figure's stability. Although Helios was 
                            usually envisaged and represented in art as a charioteer with a sun-beamed 
                            halo riding across the sky and dragging the sun behind him, the Rhodians 
                            perhaps went for a more statuesque representation for their colossal figure. 
                            Unlike many other super-famous sculptures from antiquity, though, there 
                            are no surviving representations or scale models of the Colossus in other 
                            ancient art forms to help reconstruct in detail what the Colossus may have 
                            looked like.
                        </p>
